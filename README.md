You will be asked to input several numbers,after that one crossroad will appear with lights.
### Features
 - change the color based on the iuput
 - assign cars into 4 lines (Not yet printed)
 - print the crossroad
 - check whether inputs will lead to accident (partly)
 - draw cars
### Bugs
 - place of cars sometimes is wrong
 - too slow
 - sometimes cannot find accident
### To-do list(Besides requirment)
- let 2 direction have different red-orange-green light time as long as no situation of both being green happened.
- ~~use timestamp rather than pause() to control the speed~~
- ~~show FPS in the screen~~
